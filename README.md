# Emotional Recognition

The AI Deep Learner recognizes the following 8 emotions-

* neutral, 
* happiness,
* surprise, 
* sadness, 
* anger, 
* disgust, 
* fear and
* contempt

with the help of the FER+ dataset( see citation below)
My implementation uses PLD training mode (Probabilistic Label Drawing) described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01041.

I have included my trained model (vgg13.model) in the parent directory. So you can start playing around right away. 
However do look at the "To Train" section

## Install Prerequisities
```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

## To Train

### Step 1 - Get Image Dataset

Obtain fer2013.csv from (Kaggle here)
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data]
Save the file in the parent directory (where the fer2013new.csv file is stored)

### Step 2 - Generate Images from Dataset
The fer2013.csv has pixel values for each image. The images must first be generated from this. To do this:
```
cd src
python getImages.py -d ../data -fer '../fer2013.csv' -ferplus '../fer2013new.csv'
``` 
(Generates 28 thousand training, 3.5 thousand validation and testing images each and stores it in the [data](data) folder)

###  Step 3 - Train (finally!)
```
cd src
python -W ignore train.py -d ../data -maxe 100
```
Trains the images in the FER2013Train Folder within [Data](data) for 100 epochs

#### Training with Checkpoints
In case you can't train all at one go, I have also used checkpoints (i.e. train till an epoch x and continue from it later on!)

if you trained till epoch number 10 (11 epochs), you will see model_10 in [models](data/models) directory
So to resume training from epoch 11:
```
cd src
python -W ignore train.py -d ../data -ckp ../data/models/model_10 -e 11
```

**NOTE - ** At the end of the training, code generates `vgg13.model` file in the parent directory. I have included mine!

**SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRAIN TO USE MY MODEL.**

## To Test

IMAGES SENT CAN BE PNG OR JPEG and coloured!
For good output, please ensure that there is only one person in the image.

To test a single image 
```
cd src
python -W ignore EmotionDetector.py -t 1 -m ../vgg13.model -d <path of the image>
```
OR test several images at once:
```
cd src
python -W ignore EmotionDetector.py -t 2 -m ../vgg13.model -d <path with all the images e.g. ../data/FER2013Test >
```

## To Fine Tune
To know more about fine tuning click [here](https://flyyufelix.github.io/2016/10/03/fine-tuning-in-keras-part1.html)

With regular fine tuning, my model works better with more use. Furthermore fine tuning can be used to personalize the AI 
to your face/emotions!
(to personalize the ai, make sure that the images for training are just images of you!)

Apart from the images you will also need to create a "label.csv" file (refer next section)

```
cd src
python -W ignore fine_tuning_1.py - d <folder with the training images and label.csv file>```

## Datasets and CSVs:

**_fer2013new.csv_** - usage (train,test or validation),image name, emotion confidence values for 8+2 emotions
(neutral,happiness,surprise,sadness,anger,disgust,fear,contempt,unknown,Non-Face)

**_fer2013.csv_** - main emotion,image name, pixel value
The pixels must be converted to images and stored in the right sub-folders within [data](data)

### Layout for Training
There is a folder named data that has the following layout:
```
/data
  /FER2013Test
    label.csv
  /FER2013Train
    label.csv
  /FER2013Valid
    label.csv
```
*label.csv* in each folder contains the the image name is in the following format: ferXXXXXXXX.png, where XXXXXXXX is 
the row index of the original FER csv file. So here the names of the first few images:
```
fer0000000.png
fer0000001.png
fer0000002.png
```
It also contains the scale of each emotion from 1-10 in order of neutral, happiness,	surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, 
fear, contempt, unknown, NF (no face). 


## Citation
I have the used the FER+ and FER dataset here.
The inspiration for the code comes from https://github.com/Microsoft/FERPlus
I tweaked the code at several places and added fine tuning!
